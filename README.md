# VR-Museum

## School Project : ISAE-SUPAERO VR Museum 

First year school project at ISAE-SUPAERO, the "PIC" (Project Innovation Creativity)
The goal was to bring back to life students' rocket projects, especially an ancient one, ARSENE :  a communication satellite built by students and launched to space (the red satellite)

So we made a museum that you can visit in virtual reality so that you can interact virtually with the satellites, in full 3D.

School Buildings : Google Sketchup
Other Models : Blender
Engine : Unity
VR : OpenVR Plugin

Made by :

Boris Jost : 
3D Building models & textures & interiors

Geoffroy Mordelet : 
3D models importations & conversions & satellite signs and stands 

Justine Veirier : 
3D model construction of Arsene Satellite (the red one)

Lucas Cavatoni : 
VR implementation in Unity & video
